# Rainfall Prediction using Machine Learning

## Project Description
The project aims to predict whether it will rain tomorrow or not based on historical weather data using Machine Learning algoritms.  
The prediction is made using the algorithms **Logistic Regression** and **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**.

The project was developed as a part of the final semester MCA (Master of Computer Applications) in Distance Education course at **Lovely Professional University (LPU)**.

## Tools Used
- Python
- Google Colab
- Machine Learning (Logistic Regression, KNN)
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Features
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Feature Engineering
- Model Building (Logistic Regression and KNN)
- Model Evaluation (Confusion Matrix, Classification Report)
- Visualization of Results (Correlation Heatmap, Accuracy of both Models)
